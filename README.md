# SYSTEM-SURVEILLANCE-USING-KEYLOGGER-mini-project

about the project

In many companies now-a-days data security and data recovery is the
most important factor. So there are many cases where data recovery is required.
For these kinds of problems keylogger is one of the best solutions which is
often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing.
Keyboard capturing is the action of recording the keys stroke on a keyboard,
typically covertly, so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their
actions are being monitored. Using keylogger application users can retrieve
data when working file is damaged due to several reasons like loss of power
etc.
This is a surveillance application used to track the users which logs
keystrokes; uses log files to retrieve information. Using this application we can
recall forgotten email or URL. In this keylogger project, whenever the user
types something through the keyboard, the keystrokes are captured and mailed
to the mail id of admin without the knowledge of the user within the time set.
